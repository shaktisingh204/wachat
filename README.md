**Do not commit this file to version control.**

```
# SabNode Core Configuration

# Meta/Facebook Integration (Required for Facebook & WhatsApp)
# Get these from your Meta for Developers App Dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret

# This must be your publicly accessible application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-domain.com

# Meta Webhooks (for receiving messages and updates)
# A random, secure string you will also enter in your Meta App settings.
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=a_random_secure_string_for_webhooks

# Optional: System User Token for admin actions like syncing projects
# META_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_permanent_system_user_token

# Google AI for Genkit Features
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key

# Admin Login Credentials

```

### 2. Run the Application

Once your `.env.local` file is configured, you can run the application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Setting up Webhooks

You need to create a Meta App and add the Webhooks product. 
Configure a webhook URL in your Meta App's settings to receive notifications. The URL will be `[YOUR_APP_URL]/api/webhooks/meta`.
Subscribe your app to your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA). 
You'll receive webhook notifications for various events, including changes to your WABA, phone numbers, message templates, and messages sent to your phone numbers.
